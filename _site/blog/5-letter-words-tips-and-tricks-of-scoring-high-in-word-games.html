                        <p>Give some hacks to score high by using 5 letter words. How our tool help in winning word games.</p>

<p>Wordplay got the upper hand on Twitter, and the green and yellow boxes flooded the timeline of most users. This game that tests your vocabulary is relatively simple, challenging, and competitive because of its social character.</p>

<p>We’ve already talked about Wordle, how to play it, and some other basics that you can refer to here. But even with these instructions at your fingertips, you may find it hard to guess the right five-letter word in the odds given, of which you have six in all.</p>

<p>Today we will review some tips and tricks to help you better strategize your efforts and get the correct word with the slightest chance possible.</p>

<p><strong>First guess</strong></p>

<p>Most people randomly throw a word into the first assumption and take the resulting green, yellow, and grey combination to guess number two and so on. But that means you’re going to waste one of your six chances, and I think the most important.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/2011.PNG" alt="For the first assumption, try to choose a word with many vowels, or perhaps a couple of common vowels with a few frequently used consonants. Avoid WORDS with letters like 'X,' 'Q,' and 'Z' in your first assumption." title="word game" /></p>

<p>For the first assumption, try to choose a word with many vowels, or perhaps a couple of common vowels with a few frequently used consonants. Avoid WORDS with letters like ‘X,’ ‘Q,’ and ‘Z’ in your first assumption. It might be green letters for the word of the day, but remember that the point of your first chance is to restrict your search down. Because of this, also avoid words with repeated letters for your first assumption.</p>

<p>Today I proceeded with “TABLE” for my first guess. It’s a big word because it has both “A” and “E”, vowels used quite often. I immediately get one green and two yellow squares as you can see below.</p>

<p>Making the first guess in Wordle.</p>

<p><strong>Second guess</strong></p>

<p>That’s where your contextual policy game comes in. Use the color codes of your first assumption to assess what the word could be. Remember that you should always use the green letters of previous luck in the same position and the yellow letters of the last luck in a new place.</p>

<p>Do not use shaded letters again. You might lose your chance. Use the game’s keyboard to your advantage because it will mark the shaded letters. Picture these letters have been pulled off your keyboard and you can no longer use them.</p>

<p>Try to identify the templates that commonly used words have as you are there. For instance, a ‘Q’ will almost always be followed by a ‘U’ in English, and ‘E’ and ‘A’ will usually be in the ‘EA’ order instead of the ‘AE’ order (there could always be exceptions).</p>

<p>Do not randomly place yellow letters in a new place, but try to put them in areas where they are commonly found. For example, letters such as “Z” are unlikely to be found at the last location, but letters such as “E” and “Y” are the least common letters.</p>

<p>Getting back to today’s game, I will now search for words with “A” in second place and “B” and “L” somewhere in the text. But I do know that the words “B” and “L” are unlikely to end together in that order. Instead, I’m going to pick “B” to be the first letter and put “L” let’s call it to point 3 to guess for “BALDY”, again, without using grey letters of chance one.</p>

<p>Do the second supposition in Wordle.</p>

<p><strong>Third guess</strong></p>

<p>Lucky three further, you will pretty much apply your knowledge of vocabulary patterns as you did in the second conjecture to get more green letters and, finally, the right word.</p>

<p>However, you are also going to use what I like to call the removal method, commonly used in Sudoku puzzles. Notice that you may have a couple of yellow letters being yellow on several occasions by chance, three or four. Therefore, we can eliminate these opportunities to put these letters in the only place or two left for them.</p>

<p>Again, if there are more empty spaces, use strategic vocabulary to determine where the yellow letter could go next.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/20144.PNG" alt="Again, if there are more empty spaces, use strategic vocabulary to determine where the yellow letter could go next." title="third guess" /></p>

<p>We have “B” at the beginning and “A” right next door, going back to today’s words. However, since ‘L’ has been yellow in two of the three remaining spots across the first two chances, you now know that it will occupy the last spot, making ‘L’ the last letter of the word, effectively a given green note in the next chance.</p>

<p>That only gives you two more letters to guess because the rest of the word already takes shape like “BA__L”.</p>

<p>Even if I am tempted to try the “BAGEL”, I must not forget that the “E” is already a shaded letter. I would instead look for letters that I have not yet used, letters that make sense. We should try BASIL.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth guess</strong></p>

<p>If you still haven’t guessed the right word, use the remaining three chances purely for strategic elimination while keeping in mind the abovementioned rules in case of new green and yellow letters.</p>

<p>As I think you can see, the words “S” and “I” are both grey, but the word “L” is green, as we thought it would be.</p>

<p>It’s an excellent time to see if you can get a couple of letters popping up in the word twice. Unfortunately, Wordle has no color code letters that appear twice so that it will be completely manual.</p>

<p>Since there no longer seems to be a new letter, I will now attempt to repeat the letters. Let me start with “A”, because vowels are often found twice in the same word. Therefore, my following assumption will be “BANAL”, in which I repeat the letter “A” and also add “N”, an unused letter so far.</p>

<p>Make the fourth assumption in Wordle. (Express Photo)(Express Photo)</p>

<p>As you see above, I figured out the right word with minimal effort and minimal random assumptions, which led me to the correct word with two chances of saving!</p>

<p><strong>Fifth and sixth chances</strong></p>

<p>If you still haven’t arrived at the right word, continue using the steps we tried so far from Guess 2 to Guess 4 and you should make it to the right word in the last two chances.</p>

<p>Beware of each clue The only wrong assumption in Wordle is that it does not consider the hints that preceded it. The yellow and green boxes that we want to see with every guess are essential, of course—these are the key clues that we use to solve the puzzle. But grey letters are also important. If your first guess clarifies that R, S, and T aren’t in the day’s word, using any of those letters in a next guess is throwing that guess away.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/201554.PNG" alt="Words can be two in the same letter." title="Words can be two" /></p>

<p>Although it is a bad idea to begin with words where the same letter appears more than once, it is essential to remember that such words may be the solution of the day. Once you’ve figured out a few letters and start narrowing down the possible answers, don’t be afraid to drop in a guess with recurring letters if you think it fits.</p>

<h2 id="use-the-same-browser-day-in-and-day-out"><strong>Use the same browser day in and day out.</strong></h2>

<p>There is no login to Wordle; it tracks your progress using cookies. So if continuity is important — the game automatically follows how many times you’ve played and how many rounds it took you each time — you’ll want to make sure you’re using the same computer/device and browser to play every day. You should also avoid playing in the Incognito/Private browser windows.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-the-cog-icon"><strong>Don’t forget the cog icon.</strong></h2>

<p>Wordle is amazingly explicit and easy to read and play. But! There is a settings page, and you can change some things about your gambling experience there. I am a great fan of the dark theme, replacing the white background with a black background.</p>

<p>The problematic mode also requires every conjecture to account for the clues you have collected so far. If you have found three letters, you will have to use them in your suppositions.</p>
