                        <p><strong>History of the game</strong></p>

<p>Scrabble is a word game that involves two to four players, who score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter onto the game board. The board is divided into 15 x 15 grid of squares. This game was first developed by an architect in 1938, Alfred Mosher Butts. The first variation of this game was a crude one and was named Lexicon. Later Butts made some changes to the game and this was named Criss Crosswords. In 1948, James Brunot a resident of Newtown, Connecticut bought the rights from Butts to manufacture the game. In return Butt’s was to get a royalty on every unit sold.</p>

<p>Scrabble is a fantastic game that is much loved by both old and young. First created in 1933, over 121 billion versions of this game have been sold worldwide and in 31 different languages!. A Braille version of this game is also available for game lovers. Now, Scrabble is not only a really exciting game, it has much more to offer its players. To help explain the wonderful merits of Scrabble, let us look at some of the benefits it has to offer.</p>

Individuals who play this game quickly pick up on the skills to recognize prefixes and suffixes with much ease. Playing this game is similar to playing a crossword puzzle game. Besides learning different words, and their spellings you also benefit by learning what those words actually mean. This game is played by either 2 or 4 people. This game can be played both for a pass time with family or with a competitive spirit at tournaments. Although you are not supposed to use a dictionary while playing this game, most young players learn different new words with the help of an online dictionary like <a href="https://wordfinder.tips/scrabble-word-finder" title="https://wordfinder.tips/scrabble-word-finder">https://wordfinder.tips/scrabble-word-finder</a>. Players’ word learning skills definitely improve as they learn from one another. As young players start advancing towards a pro-level, competing against professional and mature players, definitely prepares the new players in a better manner. Games like these have a positive effect on kids, as they learn new words, spellings, and their meaning in a fun way. Scrabble is a chance to get your kids interested in learning the English language, without telling them that they are having a lesson. Since most children are inquisitive by nature, this gam assists in sparking a gaming interest in the learners.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble can improve mental abilities</strong></p>

<p>Most of us are interested in playing games that utilize the full potential of the brain.There have been several types of research conducted in the past that state that playing word games can improve your cognitive capacity. Such games also compensate for our lack of education. Regular indulgence in cognitive stimulating games has proven to delay diseases like Alzheimer’s or dementia. Some rare words could also help you gain knowledge about science and technology.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble teaches you about strategy</strong></p>

<p>Scrabble has some interesting as well as challenging features. Some of the letters are riskier than others to be played. Strategy in this game involves planning some words ahead in this game. Sometimes making a better score isn’t worth it because your opponent might just come across an opportunity to make bigger scores than you.</p>

<p>Although there is a possibility for an opponent to block planned words, players are struggling to build some word combinations to get the chance to use the Double and Triple Word or Letter Score squares found on the board. This will maximize the points you will be awarded for using your letter tiles.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble encourages social bonding and cooperation</strong></p>

<p>Scrabble is a fun game to play with your family, friends, or even strangers. This is a really fun and competitive game. This game provides you with a great opportunity to strike some interesting conversations with fellow competitors. This is a great game that unites players of all ages. As long as you showcase knowledge of words, you can play. There is even children’s version that is meant for children to play and learn Scrabble. Playing games together can help you to learn about adapting new rules and co-operating to work together.</p>

<p>Since in Scrabble, you have to interact with others, this improves cognitive performance and keeps your mind sharp. Playing games with your friends can also decrease your stress factor.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble helps to improve emotional well being and improve confidence</strong></p>

<p>Since in Scrabble you have to solve logical problems, even if you do not win the game you will definitely derive a sense of confidence. Scrabble being a word game also brings out the creativity in the player. Children are often forced to think with a creative mind to be able to construct words from the tiles they have.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble boost the immune system and makes you happy</strong></p>

Playing Scrabble with your loved ones is indeed keeps you happy and healthy. The laughing will increase endorphins in your body that will trigger a feel good reaction.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble develops concentration</strong></p>

<p>With the world developing at a fast pace, our concentration level seems to have shortened. In order to play Scrabble effectively, this game demands full concentration. This can help kids become more efficient in focusing. As the world develops, we are often bombarded with information and distraction. Whether we are cleaning our homes or doing our dishes, we often feel the itch to check our mobile phones to stay updated on social media or to check the latest trends. These often hamper our ability to concentrate and work efficiently. In order to counteract these diversions, one must practice focus, and what could be better than learning how to focus through a game.</p>

<p><strong>Scrabble can improve your business skills</strong></p>

<p>Playing scrabble will motivate you to become a successful businessman. Surprised, huh? Yeah, you’re not going to be. Scrabble is a lot more than just a word game. It’s basically called a strategy game that will teach you critical reasoning, concentration, and even imagination.</p>

<p>How will scrabble play boost your market capabilities?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check out various views. Often you look forever at your letters, and you can’t see any of them. Quite sometimes, it’s enough to shuffle them a bit, to make something appear in your head right away. There’s still a solution, but sometimes you need a certain catalyst to reach it.</li>
  <li>In market, much as in scrabble, you need to plan accordingly, even though you know that other players might obstruct you on your way. Don’t hang on to your best letters whilst you’re playing, and don’t save your best investments for later in business, or there will be no later for you. When you’re playing, you’re trying to maximize your scores, and you can still try to maximize your gains when bargaining, in real life.</li>
  <li>Don’t be afraid to take advantage of the best money. There are moments, of course, where it’s easier to wait for the right scenario, but most of the time, you need to play what you’ve got. Much like you’re not meant to save your highest point letters later, you’re also not supposed to wait for any chances or waste your new abilities just to acquire some.</li>
  <li>Quite frequently, when playing scrabble, people concentrate on their own tiles without noticing the board. That’s how they skip great opportunities—sometimes all you have to do is use one of the letters to enlarge an established term. Company is similar – give yourself a big picture target and consider all the aspects that can affect your way of achieving it. Don’t just focus on what you’ve got.</li>
  <li>If you play scrabble, you don’t want to use fantastic letters enough to build an even better possibility for your competitors; you don’t play double-word score square if you know that your rival will make it triple. Evaluate might deal carefully, don’t just bid to contest it, and take care of the clients so that they don’t have to go shopping for another supplier and get robbed from rivalry.</li>
  <li>The rich vocabulary and proper spelling are important. In both scrabble and company, it is important to know the correct words and to be able to spell them correctly. You can end up sending an email with an error or make a mistake in your Linkedin report or profile, which can both send a meaningful message to your present and future bosses, superiors, or partners.</li>
  <li>Often you fail, but you’re still studying. You can’t always be the best, particularly at the beginning. Nothing is wrong with mistakes, as long as you can benefit from them. In Scrabble, you can learn from more seasoned and stronger rivals and learn from your company rivals and partners. Keep available, and don’t be discouraged.</li>
  <li>Just want to love it. Business can be difficult and be centered around too much money, just as scrabble can be too competitive. It is necessary to preserve the balance, though, for the sake of your own wellbeing. Therefore, Scrabble is a beneficial game that can work wonders and assist one not only in improving vocabulary but also social skills.</li>
